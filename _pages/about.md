I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [UCL Cybersecurity Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-cdt/). My research broadly focuses on privacy, security, and human-computer interaction. I work on understanding the social dynamics of coercive influence on online social platforms, as well as developing tools to enable marginalized/vulnerable populations to protect themselves from such privacy-violating behaviors. I am supervised by [Dr. Marie Vasek](https://mvasek.com), [Dr. Leonie Tanzcer](https://www.leonietanczer.net/about.html), and [Dr. Mark Warner](https://markjwarner.github.io).
