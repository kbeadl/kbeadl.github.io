I am a third year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the [UCL Cybersecurity Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-cdt/). 

My research broadly focuses on privacy, online safety, and human-computer interaction. My interdisciplinary work focuses:
- Scrutinizing the surveillance possibilities of digital services and emerging technologies
- Improving digital services (and content moderation) for marginalized and vulnerable people
- Evaluating the security and privacy implications of research methods

In my ongoing thesis, I investigate the social dynamics of coercive influence in online social platforms and how it affects privacy behaviors, with a particular focus on the impacts within LGBTQ+ online communities. I am supervised by [Dr. Marie Vasek](https://mvasek.com), [Dr. Leonie Tanzcer](https://www.leonietanczer.net/about.html), and [Dr. Mark Warner](https://markjwarner.github.io).
