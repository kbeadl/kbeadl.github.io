About Me
======

I am a Computer Science PhD student at the UCL Cybersecurity Centre for Doctoral Training. My research broadly focuses on privacy, security, and human-computer interaction. I work on understanding the social dynamics of coercive influence on online social platforms, as well as developing tools to enable marginalized/vulnerable populations to protect themselves from such privacy-violating behaviors. I am supervised by Dr. Marie Vasek, Dr. Leonie Tanzcer, and Dr. Mark Warner.
