title: "Peer Surveillance in Online Communities"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023wips
excerpt: 'By synthesizing over 40 years of developments in the analysis of surveillance, we derive properties of online communities that enable the abuse of user data by fellow com- munity members and suggest key steps to improving security for vulnerable users. Deploying this new framework on new and existing platforms will ensure that online communities are privacy-conscious and designed more inclusively.'
