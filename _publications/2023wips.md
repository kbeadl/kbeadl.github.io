excerpt: 'By synthesizing over 40 years of developments in the analysis of surveillance, we derive properties of online communities that enable the abuse of user data by fellow community members and suggest key steps to improving security for vulnerable users. Deploying this new framework on new and existing platforms will ensure that online communities are privacy-conscious and designed more inclusively.'
